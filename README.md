Make sure your $GOPATH is well configured. If it is, then just do the following;

```
cd $GOPATH/go/
```

* Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ch3nkula/libxml2json.git
```

* Change directory into the folder
``` 
cd libxml2json

For now, it should be this way since the library is still under developement
